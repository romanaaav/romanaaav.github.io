            <p>
                Currently I'm a software engineering student with two years happily developing software. With the right
                tools and the right approach, there's nothing impossible to create.

                    Is impressive how different tecnologies became necessary in every human task. Time goes on and we
                    acomplish things that
                    were unthinkable a year ago, each year we increase our quality of living using tecnologies that break
                    the boundaries of our
                    imagination. As software developer, I want to be part of that.

                I started learning Java three years ago as my first programming language and it's tools such as
                Spring, Spring Security, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Maven, Postman and JIRA to develop server-side solutions,
                also, I'm able create aesthetic and responsive graphical user interfaces for web products with HTML5,
                CSS3 and Javascript Jquery, Bootstrap, and other design tools.
