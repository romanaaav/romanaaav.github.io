            Currently I'm a software engineering student with two years happily developing software. With the right
            tools and the right approach, there's nothing impossible to create.

                    Is impressive how different tecnologies became necessary in every human task. Time goes on and we
                    acomplish things that
                    were unthinkable a year ago, each year we increase our quality of living using tecnologies that break
                    the boundaries of our
                    imagination. As software developer, I want to be part of that.

            I started learning Java three years ago as my first programming language and it's tools such as
            Spring, Spring Security, Spring MVC, Hibernate, Maven, Postman and JIRA to develop server-side solutions.

                    Using Java as first programming language, experience with all kinds of implementations is granted,
                    going from
                    simple desktop applications, Back-End services and microservices connected to large-scale distributed systems.
                    Together with
                    the most powerful development tools such as Maven, JUnit, Hibernate, Spring in it's different
                    packages like Spring Security, Spring Boot,  Spring MVC and Data/JPA.

                    Modern software products require aesthetic and responsive graphical user interfaces in all kinds of products,
                    those are delivered thanks to top-end design tools in the Adobe Suit, HTML5,
                    CSS3 and Javascript Jquery, Bootstrap, in order to make tools and products appealing to the final user.

                    The use of code-foreign tools is required in orden to complement the production of software, testing tools JIRA,
                    and Postman can be used to deliver safe, fully functional implementations. I count with experience deploying 
                    server side products through Amazon Web Services, specially EC2 servers, with knowledge of Linux Servers to
                    configure operational production servers from scratch.

            Going from food delivery websites, apps and services, to large scale distributed systems with complex
            microservices schemes. In my portfolio or GitHub you can check some examples.
